;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Yapfify uses yapf to format a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
;; certain buffer, but more conveniently, a minor-mode 'yapf-mode' is provided
;; that turns on automatically running YAPF on a buffer before saving.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Add yapfify.el to your load-path.
;;
;; To automatically format all Python buffers before saving, add the function
;; yapf-mode to python-mode-hook:
;;
;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'yapf-mode)
;;
;;; Code:


(defun yapfify-call-bin (input-buffer output-buffer start-line end-line)
  "Call process yapf on INPUT-BUFFER saving the output to OUTPUT-BUFFER.
Return the exit code."
  (with-current-buffer input-buffer
    (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max) "yapf" nil output-buffer nil (concat  "-l " (number-to-string start-line) "-" (number-to-string end-line)))))

(defun get-buffer-string (buffer)
  "Return the contents of buffer"
  (with-current-buffer buffer
    (buffer-string)))
